<h3 id="ric" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 18px;">Theory-If we can find out what bats have in their DNA that protects them from showing harmful ebola symptoms, then put that key factor into a human's DNA, humans will be immune to ebola as well.</h3>

<img src="images/ebola.jpg" style="height: 450px; width: 350px; float: right; margin-bottom: 400px; margin-right: 12%; border: solid; border-color: black; border-width: 5px">
<h4 style="color: black; text-align: left; margin-left: 12%">After many disagreements and complications, our team <br>finally came to a solid conclusion.  Initally, we started with a <br>whole other idea.  Then, we realized many factors that would <br>come into play and decided that we needed to adjust some<br>things. Concludingly, we decided that we were going to do<br> something extrodinary; we decided to find a method  to<br> theoretically find a cure to the ebola virus.</h4>
<h4 style="color: black; margin-left: 12%;">The current solution is nothing.  By that, we mean there is no<br> cure.  Our protype is a method to finding a cure.  If all goes right,<br> eventually we will have discovered the cure for the ebola virus.<br>  When an ebloa outbreak occurs in today's world, thoes who are<br> infected are quarentined.  this process is  very isolatingf and<br> emotionally depressing for the victim.  If we can proceed with <br>our "cure", this will no longer be the case.  We can vaccinate <br>the majority of a comunity to create herd immunity.</h4>
<h2 style=" color: black; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 12%;"> Description of Prototype</h2>
	<h4 style="color: black; margin-left: 12%">
		Our prototype consists of a small dart that is shot from a rifle<br>then sticks into a bat eventually falling off.  Bats, specifically <br>fruit bats are the main vectors of ebola.  Therefore, fruit bats are <br>the main targets.  Then, that dart will have a chip which sends<br> the animal's DNA to a program that scientists have installed <br>in their computer system.  Ultimately, they will be able to see <br>all the amino acid break downs and through research, discover<br> which protein that animal has prevents it from showing harmful <br>symptoms of ebola.  After testing, by inserting the different proteins<br> in other animals and finding which protein prevents harmful <br>symptoms. Theoretically, if we give that key protein into <br>a human's DNA through vaccination, they too will show no<br> harmful symptoms.  In other words, they will be safe.  Furthermore,<br> this procedure can also be performed on other wild animals, and<br> pets to keep the communities safe from the horrible viral infection.
