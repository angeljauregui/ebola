<h2> What is Ebola?</h1>
	<p> Ebola is a virus that targets cells that are located in your liver, immune system, and the endothelial which lines up inside the blood vessels. Once the Ebola is in your system the protein from the virus (glycoprotein) causes your cells to lose adhesion. This means both the healthy tissue and the cells will have trouble sticking together. This all causes the host to have hemorrhaging and internal bleeding.</p>
