	<h2> What is Ebola?</h1>
	<p> Ebola is a virus that targets cells that are located in your liver, immune system, and the endothelial which lines up inside the blood vessels. Once the Ebola is in your system the protein from the virus (glycoprotein) causes your cells to lose adhesion. This means both the healthy tissue and the cells will have trouble sticking together. This all causes the host to have hemorrhaging and internal bleeding.</p>

<h2> Where it originated from</h2>
It first originated in several West African countries. However it was discovered in 1976 near the Ebola river which is how the virus got its name. Not only that, within the same year the carriers for this deadly virus were and still is in wild animals. The first main carriers are bats especially fruit bats. Eventually, monkeys,chimpanzees, and small African antelope got infected by the bats feces.
